# Bayne Lab Github Use Guidelines

________________________________________
**Objectives**

All members (e.g.., graduate students; postdocs, research associates) of the Bayne Lab are expected to use Github to share and archive code and project-specific files. The 2 objectives of using Github as a lab are:
1.	**Project-specific archiving:** for open science, collaboration, and reproducibility 
2.	**Example script sharing**: To share code internally for commonly used applications so that students are not duplicating efforts

Using Github teaches students best practices for creating reproducible analyses in a collaborative framework; a skill that is increasingly applicable across varying careers in science.  
**Everyone is encouraged to use Open Science Foundation ([OSF](https://osf.io/)) to develop projects, and [link the OSF project to Github](https://help.osf.io/article/211-connect-github-to-a-project).**

**Github Structure Overview**

The Bayne Lab Github organization will be the unifying organization for all Github code sharing. 

* Each student or postdoc should have their own personal Github account. 
* Repos should be owned by the account of the student or postdoc who is first author on that project. 
* All students will be added to members of the Bayne Lab organization. 
* All repos including Bayne Lab work should be [mirrored](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository) to the ‘baynelab-research’ organization. 
  * Data will have to be stored elsewhere, with either open access or proprietary links written into the code.  

Each repo should contain:
* A unifying project structure to facilitate easy reproducibility 
* All scripts used to run the analyses for that project 
* Links to project or task-specific data. This includes all synthesized or processed data, including: 
  * Shared data that is housed elsewhere and can be accessed via code in your script. 
  * Raw data that requires processing including acoustic and most geospatial data. 
  * Large datasets housed elsewhere and accessed via code in your script. See Github guidelines on file size [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github). 

The two objectives (example code sharing, project code archiving) have differing repo structure and code storage rules, detailed below.

**Basic Ropository Requirements**

**Read Me**  

Each repo must have a README.md that outlines: 
* The purpose of the repository 
* A descripton of the file structure 
* Instructions for reproducing the analyis
